Ambillah surat darinya bawa kemari!' lantas berangkat kebun itu. menemukan wanita. keapdanya. 'Keluarkan surat engkau bawa!' menjawab. 'Saya membawa surat apapun.' kepadanya. 'Jika engkau menyerahkan surat engkau bawa itu. benar-benar melucuri pakaianmu!' Akhirnya. mengeluarkan secarik kertas pengikat rambutnya. lantas membawa surat Rasulullah. dibuka surat ditulis Hathib bin Ali Baltha'ah orang-orang musyrik Mekkah. dalamnya. Hathib membocorkan rahasia Rasulullah. Rasulullah lantas Hathib. 'Apa engkau lakukan ini?!' Hathib menjawab. 'Wahai Rasulullah. tergesa-gesa menuduh bukan-bukan saya. Sesungguhnya pendatang suku Quraisy. penduduk asli sana. Sebaliknya. orang-orang muhajirin (di Madinah) ini. memiliki kerabat menjaga harta benda Mekkah. ketiadaan hubungan nasab itulah. menanam jasa (orang-orang kafir Quraisy) mengganggu (yang Mekkah). tindakan kafir murtad Islam ridha kekafiran.'
